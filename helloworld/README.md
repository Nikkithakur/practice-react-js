# 3. Class Components
 - need to include 2 imports react, component class from react, export default , import in App.js

 ## Functional vs class components
 ### Functional
    - Simple functions
    - absence of this keyword
    - solution without using state
    - mainly responsible for UI
    - stateless / Dumb / Presentational components

### Class
    - Feature rich
    - maintain their own private data
    - complex UI logic
    - provide lifecycle hooks
    - stateful / smart / Container components

# 4. JSX
## Functional - ++updated
    - solution can use state, this binding
    - provide lifecycle hooks
## JSX
    - Javascript XML , write xml like code
    - not a necessity , can write react app without JSX
    - Syntactic sugar
    - camel Case

# 5. Props
    - name attribute on components
    - inspect element -> console -> object
    - props are immutable
    - for example cannot set props.name
    - this.props.attributes

# 6. State
    - every react component returns JSX
## prop vs state
### prop
    - get passed to component or function parameters
    - props in functional components, this.props in class components
### state
    - state is managed by component
    - useState Hook - functional component
    - this.state - class components
